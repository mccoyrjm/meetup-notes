## Advice for Designers Transitioning into the Field
* People who are coming in with empathy and have a sense for improving a process will do well
  * Lack of experience distrupts confidence; _"Trust your gut in how you want to solve a problem"_
* UX is **not** a cut and dry thing, it varies by the team, company, project etc.
* More impressive to see someone make their own solution as opposed to following a framework
* Focus on the problem and what the design needs to solve

## Advice for Designers Transitioning into Management
* [The Making of a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567)
* [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com/)
* You're now the one serving/supporting the team
* Management is not the end goal, there are still other positions that pay about the same and offer different challenges
* Reach out to people in leadership position! They are more than happy to share their experiences and how you can progress your career
* Get to know the people you'll be working with as a manager role

## Predictions/Thoughts on Industry due to Current COVID-19 Situation?
* Proven we can accomodate these kind of situations!
* Hope impression of field leans towards "UX isn't just designers". Multiple roles can have an influence on UX.
* Inclusive design becoming more embedded into company's processes.
* More thought into how products are used in non-ideal situation and how it scales.
* How do we walk this back to physical interaction?
  * Opportunity to assess what is important to us?
  * What practices will we adopt due to current circumstances and what will stick?
  * Not one way to solve a problem.

# Q&A

#### Can you teach soft skills or do they need to come in with them?
* On board with helping to groom those soft skills, but they need base skills coming in
* Can determine their soft skills in interview; asking for them to explain their portfolio designs

#### Any advice for Jr. UXers in terms of things to focus in on / ways to make ourselves ready to be a valuable part of your future teams? (There is a disconnect between UX study and the real world). (Wanting to move into the UX field as an adult.)
* (See [Fundamental Skill Set](#fundamental-skill-set) section)
* Tricky to focus on "one thing" to be "ready"
* If there is a space in the UX field that you're interested in (ex. Healthcare), focus in on that area.
  * "What is something interesting to me that I can explore?"
  * What you explore will be the answer to "How do you keep up with the field? What are you interested in?"
* Do research on self and company

#### What makes a good designer:developer relationship? Considering the different perspectives from each role, what can both the designer and developer do in order to ensure an effective working relationship?
* Biggest thing is communication
* Depends on other managers like Product Owner, Project Manager
  * Let both roles collaborate together
  * Developer needs to know what expectation is from Designer
  * Designer knows what Developer can do and would have an easier time developing
* Advocacy; once both roles understands the other role, they can speak more to it from their perspective.
* Give teammates the benefit of the doubt when receiving feedback. It is most likely not meant in a negative way. They most likely want to collaborate.
* Practice giving/receiving feedback.
* Getting together with developers and involve them with design process.
  * Take notes during research process; get everyone in mindset of solving problem

#### Do you have any advice for UXers starting a new job remotely due to COVID19? (Brand new job)
* Chat with team 1-on-1 via chat or video.
* Stay connected and bring work into part of your life.
  * Making your work day schedule more flexible; ex. Work few hours, take a walk, work more
* Schedule catchup time with teammates; get to know them
* Employer is probably super stressed out on how to onbaord somebody new. Show empathy to situation, ask how you can help.
* Communication, communication.

#### For someone with zero experience, when you're looking at a portfolio, what do you look for? Is there a format or style that's preferable? (Have not had a "real job" in design)
* Show how you solve problems (even if it's not a design problem). Shows you're curious and able to attack a problem.
* Come up with a problem yourself to solve or reach out to a non-profit.
* Show your process. How did you get from problem to solution? Tell the story.
* Ask employer what is your preferred format?

#### If you are the only product designer on a team responsible for research, UX, and UI is there any advice on managing the workload?
* If you have one designer on team, it's their responsibility to manage those things.
* Prioritizing those things with your team and client is most important thing to do.
* Always remember who your user is and what things should be solved for them. Then apply your research and pieces of UI to give them value in the quickest way possible.
* "WIP is the enemy of productivity."

#### What sessions/workshops are suggested to get a dev team (without a specific UX designer) to think in a more UX mindset?
* Lunch'n'learn
* Design thinking exercises with developers
